Frogger Game Clone README 
===============================================

## What is this game?

*   It's a clone of the 80s arcade game frogger. This is a bare bones version of the gameâ€™s functionality, built to demonstrate how object oriented javascript can be used in computer gaming programs. 

## How do I get the game to run?

*   You should download all the files in github repository (https://github.com/ChrisB55/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master) on to your local computer. 
*   Open the file index.html with your browser. You should see a playing area with a character and three bugs scrolling across the upper screen. 

## How do I start playing?

*   Begin by pressing the arrow directional keys on your keyboard. Your character will move up, down, left and right. 
*   Try to get the character to the top of the screen without touching the bugs. If you touch the bugs while moving the character the game resets.
